The Java Agent itself and alternative `URLClassPath` implementation is
my own creation and I have chosen to use the [GPLv3 with classpath
exception](http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/license.html) (the
same as GNU Classpath).

The tests began as a copy of work from OpenJDK, and therefore are
licensed under the [GPLv2 with classpath
exception](http://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html). This is
unfortunate because the [GPLv2 is incompatible with the
GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html).
